## Overview/Terminology

* Cassette: A _thing_ to record HTTP interactions to. Right now the only option is file system, but in the future could be other things, e.g. a key-value store
* Persisters: defines how to save requests - currently only option is the file system
* Serializers: defines how to serialize the HTTP response - currently only option is YAML
* _insert cassette_: aka, create a cassette
* _eject cassette_: aka, check for saved interactions, and replay if found
* _replay_: refers to using a cached result of a http request that was recorded earlier
* How `vcr` matches: By default it matches on the HTTP method and the URI, but you can tweak this using the `match_requests_on` option.
